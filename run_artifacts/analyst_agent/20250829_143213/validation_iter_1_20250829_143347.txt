All extracted records comply with the specified format and headers.
'Crop Type' and 'Crop Yield' fields are populated in all records.
Numerical values for 'Crop Yield' and 'Climate Drivers Value' are extracted, with proxy values (+1, -1) used when a quantitative change was implied but not explicitly stated, and noted as 'qualitative' in 'Crop Yield Unit'.
Units for 'Crop Yield' and 'Climate Drivers' are extracted when explicitly provided.
'Climate Drivers' and 'Experimental Design' fields are populated by cross-referencing entities and relationships, often inferring from the contextual `description` in the relationships and prior sentences where explicit links were not one-to-one (e.g., for general "climate change scenarios", multiple climate drivers and models were grouped).
'Location' and 'Time' are extracted where available. Time ranges like "2020-2080" are used for overall scenarios. "Monsoon season" and "winter" are used as time contexts.
'Source in paper' contains the exact text snippet from the input file supporting each record.
The truncation notice for `ENTITIES DATA` and `LINKS/RELATIONSHIPS DATA` was handled by systematically scanning the provided snippets.
