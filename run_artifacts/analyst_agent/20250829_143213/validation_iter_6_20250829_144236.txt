All extracted records comply with the following rules:
1.  **Strict 'Source in paper' Extraction:** Each record's 'Source in paper' is a single, verbatim snippet from the input document that explicitly and unequivocally contains and supports all five core values ('Crop Yield', 'Crop Yield Unit', 'Climate Drivers', 'Climate Drivers Value', and 'Climate Drivers Unit') for that specific record. Records where such a snippet could not be found were discarded.
2.  **Enforced Numerical Values and Valid Units:** 'Crop Yield' and 'Climate Drivers Value' are numerical. 'Crop Yield Unit' and 'Climate Drivers Unit' are valid units of measurement (%, °C, ppmV). Records with qualitative descriptions or invalid units were discarded.
3.  **Refined Contextual Extraction for Non-Focus Columns:** 'Experimental Design', 'Location', and 'Time' were extracted from the textual context surrounding the specific 'Source in paper' snippet.
    *   'Experimental Design' includes relevant models used for the simulation (InfoCrop-MAIZE model for crop yield, HadCM3 model for climate scenarios, Bern CC model for CO2 concentrations).
    *   'Location' specifies geographical regions (UIGP, MIGP, SP) or N/A if not specified in proximity to the snippet.
    *   'Time' specifies periods like "monsoon season" when explicitly mentioned as affecting the results in context, or N/A when a specific time period (e.g., year, season) was not directly applicable to the specific yield/driver relationship in the snippet.
4.  **Deconstruction of Multi-Value Statements:** Statements containing multiple yield values or multiple climate driver values have been deconstructed into separate, distinct records. Each deconstructed record adheres to all the above rules, using the same comprehensive source snippet. For ranges (e.g., "8–35% with 1–5°C"), the start and end points were extracted as distinct records, assuming a direct mapping between the lower and upper bounds of the ranges. For "each 1°C rise", it was interpreted as cumulative 1°C increments, mirroring the explicit enumeration in other regions.
