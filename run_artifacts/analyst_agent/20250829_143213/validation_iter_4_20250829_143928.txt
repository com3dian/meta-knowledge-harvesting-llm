Records were extracted by iterating through the provided entity and relationship data, prioritizing relationships that contained a complete set of verifiable information for 'Crop Yield', 'Crop Yield Unit', 'Climate Drivers', 'Climate Drivers Value', and 'Climate Drivers Unit' within their 'description' field.

Specific validation steps and decisions:
1.  **Strict 'Source in paper' Enforcement**: For each extracted record, the 'Source in paper' field contains the *exact verbatim text snippet* from the input data that directly and unequivocally supports the combined Crop Yield, Crop Yield Unit, Climate Drivers, Climate Drivers Value, and Climate Drivers Unit. Records where any of these critical fields were not explicitly supported by a single, specific snippet were discarded (e.g., general statements about "offsetting yield loss" without a quantified yield change, or yield changes attributed generally to "climate change" without specifying the drivers/values).
2.  **Multi-value/Multi-driver Records**:
    *   For UIGP temperature impacts, the snippet "The mean baseline yield of rainfed maize crop is about 2 Mg ha⁻¹ in UIGP, where the projected yield loss is up to 7, 11, 15, 22, and 33% relative to baseline yields with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5°C degrees rise in atmospheric temperatures." explicitly lists a sequence of yield losses corresponding to a sequence of temperature rises (e.g., 7% with 1°C, 11% with 2°C, etc.). This allowed for clear deconstruction into 5 distinct single-driver records, each using the full snippet as its 'Source in paper'.
    *   For SP temperature impacts, the snippet "The SP region is also projected to experience adverse impact with -10, -15, -23, -27 and -35% reductions from the baseline yield levels at each 1°C rise in temperature." was ambiguous. The phrase "at each 1°C rise in temperature" could imply each listed yield loss occurred at an *additional* 1°C rise (i.e., -10% at 1°C, -15% at 2°C, etc.) or that each reduction occurred at *a* 1°C rise. The provided `LINKS` data only explicitly linked '-10' to '1'. Without explicit links for the other yield reductions to specific temperature values (2, 3, 4, 5), only the -10% with 1°C record was extracted to maintain strict verifiability.
    *   For CO₂ impacts, the snippet "Even though maize is a C4 plant, increase in carbon dioxide is projected to benefit the crop yield ranging from 0.1 to 3.4% at 450 ppmV and 0.6 to 7.2% at 550 ppmV." clearly provided two distinct ranges, each associated with a specific CO₂ concentration. The minimum and maximum values for each range were extracted as separate records, each using the full snippet as its 'Source in paper'.
    *   The MIGP yield reduction range "8–35% with 1–5°C rise" was discarded as the snippet did not unequivocally link specific yield percentages to specific temperature values within the given ranges, making deconstruction into verifiable single-driver records impossible per the strict criteria.
3.  **Population of Other Fields**:
    *   **Crop Type**: Consistently 'maize' as it is the crop discussed throughout the document.
    *   **Experimental Design**: Inferred from relevant entity descriptions and general context. "simulation analysis" was used for temperature-related impacts, as suggested by the description of the 'simulation analysis' entity. "InfoCrop-MAIZE model simulations" was used for CO₂ related impacts, as the 'CO₂ concentrations' entity description explicitly links them to this model.
    *   **Location**: Extracted when explicitly mentioned in the 'Source in paper' snippet (UIGP, SP). Left blank when not specified (CO₂ impacts).
    *   **Time**: Left blank for all records as no specific year or season was *explicitly mentioned in the direct supporting snippet* for the numerical yield and driver values. General time references (e.g., "monsoon season", "2020 scenario") were only in broader contextual sentences that did not provide a complete data point.
4.  **Discarded Records**: Numerous potential records were discarded due to failing the strict 'Source in paper' criteria, primarily for lacking specific numerical 'Crop Yield', 'Climate Drivers Value', or clear connections between values and their drivers (e.g., statements about offsetting effects, general yield losses due to "climate change", or qualitative descriptions).
