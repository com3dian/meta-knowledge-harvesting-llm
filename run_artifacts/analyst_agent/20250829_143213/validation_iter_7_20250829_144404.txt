The extraction process strictly followed the specified rules:
1.  **Strict 'Source in paper' Extraction:** For each record, the longest possible, single, verbatim text snippet that explicitly and unequivocally supports *all five core values* (Crop Yield, Crop Yield Unit, Climate Drivers, Climate Drivers Value, and Climate Drivers Unit) was identified and used. Records where any of these five core values could not be fully supported by a single snippet were discarded (e.g., statements like "offset the yield loss" or general future projections without specific climate driver values/units).
2.  **Refined Contextual Entity Classification:**
    *   **Location:** Only explicit geographical names (UIGP, MIGP, SP) appearing within the 'Source in paper' snippet were extracted.
    *   **Time:** No explicit time periods or durations were found directly within the 'Source in paper' snippets that also contained all five core values. Therefore, this column is empty for all records. General time contexts from other parts of the document were not included as they were not directly supported by the specific snippet for the core values.
    *   **Experimental Design:** No study methodologies or model names (e.g., HadCM3 model, Bern CC model, InfoCrop-MAIZE model, simulation analysis) were found directly within the 'Source in paper' snippets that also contained all five core values. Therefore, this column is empty for all records.
3.  **Iterative Deconstruction:** Statements with multiple yield values or climate driver values (e.g., ranges or lists) were successfully deconstructed into separate records. Each derived record maintains its own complete and accurate 'Source in paper' snippet, and associated contextual information, adhering to the strict extraction rules. For ranges like "8-35% with 1-5째C", the lowest and highest values were extracted, as the intermediate values were not explicitly stated as distinct pairs. For "each 1째C rise", the values were interpreted as 1째C, 2째C, etc., corresponding to the listed yield impacts.
4.  **Source Parsing:** The provided ENTITIES DATA and LINKS/RELATIONSHIPS DATA were systematically parsed to identify and extract relevant information according to these updated rules.

**Self-correction/Refinement during thought process:**
*   Initially considered inferring 'Crop Type' from general document context or 'Time' from general statements about regions/seasons. However, the strict instruction to ensure the 'Source in paper' "explicitly and unequivocally supports *all five core values*" and "associated contextual information" led to a stricter interpretation. If 'Location', 'Time', or 'Experimental Design' were not present *within the exact snippet* identified as the 'Source in paper' for the 5 core values, they were left blank to adhere to the rule's strictness.
*   The interpretation of "longest possible, single, verbatim text snippet" for deconstructed records means using the full sentence that contains the multiple values, as this single sentence supports all the deconstructed sub-records.
*   Records describing qualitative effects ("offset yield loss", "improve yields") or those lacking a specific climate driver value/unit were discarded as per rule 1.
*   Implied 'maize' as Crop Type for "yield" or "grain yield" was considered reasonable given the document's singular focus on maize.
