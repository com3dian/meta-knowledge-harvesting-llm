All records have a verifiable 'Source in paper' directly supporting the extracted 'Crop Yield', 'Climate Drivers', and 'Climate Drivers Value'.
All 'Crop Yield' entries are numerical percentages, including the offset effect for rainfall in SP which was directly quantifiable based on the specified temperature loss in that region.
Records indicating general "climate change" effects or qualitative descriptions of yield impacts without specific numerical values or a single, quantifiable climate driver were discarded as per rules 1, 2, and 3.
The "20% rainfall increase offsets yield loss due to 1°C rise" and "30% increase in rainfall is predicted to offset the adverse impact of 2°C rise" statements were discarded because the "yield loss due to 1°C rise" was not a single, universally quantified value in the text (it varied by region), preventing precise numerical inference for the offset when no specific location was mentioned for these general statements.
Records based on "water stress" or "Maize crop during winter is provided with assured irrigation" were discarded because they either lacked numerical yield quantification or did not clearly link to a defined 'Climate Driver' as per the schema and instructions.
Experimental Design, Location, and Time fields were populated by re-scanning the entire provided text. For projected yields, the detailed model names and their coupling were used for 'Experimental Design'. 'Location' was extracted when specifically mentioned in the source snippet. 'Time' was populated only when a specific year was associated with the yield or driver in the direct source snippet; otherwise, it was left blank.
